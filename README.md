1. K-Means.py: The code consists of implementation of K-means algorithm for a dataset (mixture model) of weights and heights. In oder to run the code, download the .csv file and the .py files and modify the path of the file in the code for reading the code, if necessary. Then, run it using 'python3.8 /path/K-means.py' on the command line. The user will see two plots-the first one is a scatter plot of the raw data and the second one the plot after implementing the K-means algorithm to the data.

2. K-Means_1.py: This code consits of a part that generates data using 'make blobs'. One can play around with the number of centers, sample size, etc. With increasing number of clusters (centers), the k-means algorithm starts becoming inefficient.
